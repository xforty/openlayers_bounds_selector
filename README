OpenLayers Bounds Selector
==========================

https://github.com/xforty/openlayers_bounds_selector

Drupal plugin for selecting and storing a bounding box in a field.

Provides a new 'Bounds Selector' widget for the text field type.  This widget

selection box. The text field will be filled in the selected bounding box as a
quad of lat/long coordinates (left, bottom, right, top).
